    This research project examines the rise of totalitarian regimes by analyzing how fear, isolation, and propaganda 
    are used to control populations. It focuses particularly on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, exploring how the 
    government reshaped society through extreme political, social, and cultural manipulation. The essay evaluates 
    the consequences of totalitarian rule and the long-term impact on the affected populations. This essay was one of my favorite
    pieces to write, so I hope that you will enjoy it

   This lab report aims to determine the differences in fish biodiversity between two coral reefs in the Bahamas. 
    I wrote it with 3 peers in the spring of 2025. It is my most extensive research paper and definitely the coolest project 


    that I have ever done.
