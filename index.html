            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               My Name is Alexander Graves. I am 16 years old and enrolled as a student at the Browning School in New York City.
                Something special about me is a drive to succeed in all aspects of life. This ranges from high levels of academic achievement (A 3.9 GPA)
                to my ability to construct networks of interesting people that accelerate both my thinking and provide a powerful base to succeed. Outside of school
                I am enrolled in multiple Browning extracurriculars, such as debate and applied algorithms. Outside of school, extracurriculars, I have done internships 
                at Nebula Research and Development, a NYC-based hedge fund. Outside of Nebula, I have also worked with Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a renowned financial 
                publication known for thier bearsish views on the market. In addition to these for-profit companies, I have also worked with New York Cares, 
                A nonprofit focused on assisting disabled people in the city, as well as including other members of the Browning community. I find that helping others gives me a sense of purpose. When I am not working, 
                I try to better myself. A great deal of personal time is spent on market research, as finance is the industry that I am most interested in. In my  stock portfolio, 
                this research has yielded many gains; I have been long Palantir since 2022, yielding a 2000% percent yield. Although Palantir has been my most lucrative purchase, 
                others have yielded high returns, such as the SPDR Gold Trust and AFFRM. Outside of investing, I am a ravenous reader. Last year, I read 104 full-length books,
                spanning a range of genres, including fantasy, the classics, psychology, and political science.
