      Reading has always been, and remains, my favorite pastime. There is nothing like getting lost in a book, and reading also provides many benefits.
      Reading is known to improve memory, vocabulary, discipline, critical thinking, creativity, and mental sharpness. I always incorporate at least one hour of reading into my day,
      and more if I have the time. Last year, I read over 100 books, and have included some of my favorites in the image above. This year, I want to incorporate more finance and economics
      articles into my reading itinerary to expand my reach and grasp new subjects. Last year, this goal was to read more psychology, which I did (11 Novels). Setting these goals also helps
      me prove to myself that I can follow through and better myself

    <h2>Skiing</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- Replace this with your own writing -->
      Skiing is my favorite activity/hobby, and I try to ski as much as possible. Skiing, along with being fun, has taught me many invaluable lessons. Skiing has taught me discipline: Waking up
      extremely early, practicing over and over again, sticking to something and never quitting, as well as enduring sub-zero temperatures in thin racing gear. For me, Skiing is a skill that I have been building for well over a decade,
      and when I look back, I can see how far I have come. Other than invaluable life lessons, the sport is and always has been a key part of my identity; I wouldn't be complete without it.
      Unfortunately, I am unable to race this year because of other obligations, but I always try to find time to practice and make myself a little better.
